# Astra UI Kit 🌌

Astra UI Kit is a comprehensive, easy-to-use UI component library for React applications, designed with TypeScript for robustness and type safety. Built upon styled-components, it provides a stellar collection of reusable components to equip developers with the tools they need to create out-of-this-world user interfaces.

## Installation

```bash
npm install astra-ui-kit
```

or if you prefer using yarn:

```bash
yarn add astra-ui-kit
```

### dependence

```bash
npm install @types/styled-components
```

or if you prefer using yarn:

```bash
yarn add @types/styled-components
```

## Example Usage

Here is a basic usage example:

```tsx
import { Button, Box } from "astra-ui-kit";
import "./App.css";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Box>
      <Button>Test Button</Button>
    </Box>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, we import the `Button` component from the Astra UI Kit and use it in our `App` component.
